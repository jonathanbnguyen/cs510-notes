    "\n",
    "Each parse tree has a unigue leftmost derication, which can be consructed by a preorder traversal of the tree. Thus, the **ambiguity of a grammar** can also be tested by searching for two different leftmost derivations of the same string.\n",

    "**Ambiguous** grammars present dofficulties, since no clear structure is expressed. The grammar must be revised to remove the ambiguity or a disambiguating rule must be stated to establish which structure is meant. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thinking about the semantics attached to the expression, we can understand what this decision means. The ***first*** syntax tree implies that the mulitplication operator * is to be applied to the 4 and 5 (resulting in the value 20) and this result is added to 3 to get 23. The ***second*** syntax tree, on the right, says to add 3 and 4 first (resulting 7) and then multiply by 5 to get 35. Thus, the operations are applied in a different order resulting in different semantics.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we take the usual meaning of the expression $ 3 + 4 * 5 $ from mathmatics, it is best to choose the first tree, since multiplication has precedence over addition. \n",
    "\n",
    "To state the illustrate the precedence over addition; we could state the **disambiguating rule** seperately from the grammer. \n",
    "\n",
    "The usual way to revise the grammar is to write a new grammar rule (called a \"term\") that will establish a \"*precedence cascade*\" to force the matching of the * at a lower point in the parse tree: \n",

    "- $ expr \\rightarrow expr + expr \\mid term $\n",
    "- $ term \\rightarrow term * term \\mid (expr) \\mid number $\n",
    "\n",
    "But, this is not completely solved the ambiguity problem, however, because thhe rule for an *expr* still allows us to parse $ 3 + 4 * 5 $ as either $ (3 + 4) * 5 $ or $ 3 + (4 * 5) $. This means that addition can be either **right-** or **left-associative**\n",
